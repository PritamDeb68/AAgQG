It can be found in the lumbar (lower back) or thoracic (mid-back) area. Levoscoliosis is a slight left curvature of the spine.     The lumbar region is between the thoracic and the sacral (sacrum) areas of the spine. It include L1 through … L5. Generally, this area lies between the 10th rib(s) down to 1-2 below the top of the pelvis.The standard definition of scoliosis is the curvature of the spine in one direction or another. Levoscoliosis is the curvature of the spine to the left side of the body. Levoscoliosis has the same signs and symptoms as the classical scoliosis, but due to the location of the heart there are added health concerns due to with the left curvature in the thoracic spine (midback). The symptoms of levoscoliosis can appear at any time and is primarily observed by back pain and/or changes in posture. Postural changes can include: one shoulder higher than the other, a protruding shoulder blade, uneven hips, etc.",factual,"['What is levoscoliosis?', 'Where in the spine can levoscoliosis occur?', 'What is the standard definition of scoliosis?', 'What are the symptoms of levoscoliosis?']"

93,"Most basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are caused by repeated and unprotected skin exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, as well as from man-made sources such as tanning beds. UV rays can damage the DNA inside skin cells. DNA is the chemical in each of our cells that makes up our genes. Researchers don’t yet know all of the DNA changes that result in skin cancer, but they have found that in many skin cancers the cells have changes in tumor suppressor genes. The gene most often altered in squamous cell cancers is called TP53. This tumor suppressor gene normally causes cells with damaged DNA to die.In this article. Font Size. A. A. A.
